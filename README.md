Here you can enter your first and last names, your email, phone number and you can create a password and confirm it. Dynamically the website is going to check if your password is written according to the set pattern and will show you an easy-to-understand UI for it. Also the website is going to check if your presented passowords match each other.

What did I practice with this project:

- how to create forms with HTML;
- how to use form validation by using only built-in HTML validations;
- how to style form with CSS, JS and HTML;
- how to validate forms using JS;
- how to use RegExp.
